# pi3-tempsensors
Pythong script to read from multiple DS18B20 + 1wire sensors and post data to web hook, there is an apiary defintion file if you want to quickly create a mock api call that will respond with a 201(created) response and some test data if you dont have the api available yes



*Thanks*
Thanks to these guys for the initial script, ive since adapted it to handle multiple sensors and working on http post next.
